      A vulnerability exists in Async through 3.2.1 (fixed in 3.2.2) , which could let a malicious user obtain privileges via the mapValues() method.
      This is a false positive as the vulnerability exists in a NPM Javascript package named 'Async' and not the nuget .NET package named 'Serilog.Sinks.Async'.
